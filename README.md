Assessment 3 Software development Help desk Ticketing Code
Project Description:This project is a prototype of a Help Desk Ticketing System that allows internal customers to submit tickets for IT support. The system is designed to track tickets, generate new passwords for password change requests, and keep track of statistics. It is written in Python and uses object-oriented programming concepts.
Technologies Used: Python
Challenges Faced:  One of the biggest challenges in creating this project was generating new passwords for password change requests. We had to figure out a way to extract information from the ticket and combine it in a specific way to generate the password. Another challenge was keeping track of ticket statistics, such as the number of open, closed, and resolved tickets. We had to design a system that could update these statistics automatically.
Features to Implement in the Future:
 In the future, we would like to add more functionality to the system, such as the ability to assign tickets to specific IT team members and the ability to generate reports on ticket trends over time.
